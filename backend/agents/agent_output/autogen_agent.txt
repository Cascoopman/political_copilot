Find all $x$ that satisfy the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$. Express your answer in interval notation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
assistant (to agent):

First, let's simplify the given inequality by distributing the multiplication:
$$(2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8)$$
$$2x^2 + 11x + 10 < 3x^2 + 7x + 63$$
Next, we'll get rid of the x terms by subtracting $2x^2 + 7x$ from both sides and adding $11x+63$:
$$(2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8)$$
$$2x^2 + 11x + 10 < 3x^2 + 7x + 63$$
$$2x^2 + 11x - 3x^2 - 7x < 53$$
$$-x^2 - 4x + 53 > 0$$
To solve this inequality, we'll complete the square:
$$-(x^2 + 4x) + 53 > 0$$
$$-(x^2 + 4x + 4) + 53 + 4 > 0$$
$$\left(\sqrt{57} - x\right)\left(\sqrt{57} + x\right) > 2$$
Now, we'll find the interval of $x$ that satisfies this inequality. Since $\sqrt{57}$ is approximately 7.615, we can express our answer as:
$$\boxed{\left(-\infty, -\frac{\sqrt{57}-2}{2}\right)}$$
and
$$\boxed{\left(-\frac{\sqrt{57}+2}{2}, \infty\right)}$$
However, since we cannot represent irrational numbers exactly in Python or shell script, we'll approximate the solution using a decimal value. Let's use $\sqrt{57} \approx 7.483$:
$$\boxed{\left(-\infty, -\frac{7.483-2}{2}\right)}$$
and
$$\boxed{\left(-\frac{7.483+2}{2}, \infty\right)}$$
Approximately:
$$\boxed{\left(-\infty, -3.6915\right)}$$
and
$$\boxed{\left(-2.3905, \infty\right)}$$
Python code to check the solution (save as 'check_solution.py'):
```python
# filename: check_solution.py
import cmath
def f(x):
    return ((2*x+10)*(x+3) < (3*x+9)*(x+8))
for x in range(-5, 6):
    if f(x):
        print("Solution found: x =", x)
```
Run the script to check the solutions. If no solution is printed, the code is correct and the task is solved.
