Find all $x$ that satisfy the inequality $(2x+10)(x+3)<(3x+9)(x+8)$. Express your answer in interval notation.

assistant (to agent):

To find all values of $x$ that satisfy the given inequality, we can first simplify the expression on both sides:
$(2x+10)(x+3) < (3x+9)(x+8)$
Expanding the products and distributing the inequalities, we get:
$2x^2 + 11x + 30 < 3x^2 + 27x + 63$
Subtracting $2x^2$ from both sides and factoring out $x$:
$x(x+11) < 3x(x+8)$
Dividing both sides by $(x+11)$, we get:
$x < \frac{3}{4}(x+8)$
Subtracting $\frac{3}{4}x$ from both sides, we get:
$\frac{-1}{4}x < \frac{27}{4}$
Multiplying both sides by $-4$:
$-4x > -27$
Dividing both sides by $-4$:
$x > 6.75$
Since the inequality sign is reversed, we want to find all values of $x$ that are greater than $6.75$. Therefore, the answer is expressed in interval notation as $(6.75, \infty)$.
Note: The solution set does not include $x = -3$, since it makes one side equal to zero and the other side negative, which violates the inequality.

CONTINUE, because there are no values of $x$ that satisfy the given inequality when $x = -3$.

You're correct. The solution set does not include $x = -3$, since it makes one side equal to zero and the other side negative, which violates the inequality. Therefore, the answer is expressed in interval notation as $(6.75, \infty)$ without including $-3$.
