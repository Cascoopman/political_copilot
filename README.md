# Political Copilot
## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a team of autonomous RAG-Agents that are experts in the political landscape of Flanders.
Ideally, the agents can distil complex and recent government documents and turn them into simple answers. Having the agents interact with eachother allows for a dynamic analysis of the political landscape.
Users such as citizens and journalists can gain more insights in their questions.
We focus on the Flemish government.

## Why?
We believe that citizens have the right to be informed. 
This tool allows them to digest and interact with the vast ocean of political data out there. 
Informed citizens ensure their vote contributes to a welfaring society.
