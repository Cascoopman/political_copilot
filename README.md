# political_agents
## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a team of autonomous LLM Agents that are experts in the political landscape of Flanders. 

Ideally, the agents can distil complex and recent government documents into simple answers which are comprehensible for the average citizen. On top of that, having the agents debate eachother allows for dynamic analysis of the political landscape.

By asking relevant questions, each president Agent will convince the user to vote for their faction.
